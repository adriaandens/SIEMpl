# Why?

* Why are all the Enterprise SIEMs so bad?
* Why are all out of the box queries somehow bad? I actually know the answer to this: companies are all different and out-of-the-box queries cannot be expected to know the quirks of companies. Each company will need to make small adaptations to the queries to "tune" the query for their environment.
* Why is the UI not made for incident analysis? Modern UIs with crazy amounts of whitespace only shows you about 5 or 10 events on a full page. How are people able to use UIs like this?
* Why is there no focus on correctness? Somehow it's hard to figure out if the system is running correctly. There are no gaps in the data, no data was skipped when running scheduled queries, no query is broken, ...
* Why is asset management always a mess? 
* Why aren't they using Graph theory?
* Why is their query language limiting?
* Why is developing parsers such a pain?
